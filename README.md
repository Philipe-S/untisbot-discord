# webuntis-disbot
This is my project for creating a Bot that can get Data from the WebUntis API and detect changes in the timetable. The detected changes will then be processed to create a visual Output Timetable (currently done with the Python plotly library). The Visual Output can then be sent to a Discord channel with a Discord Bot.
