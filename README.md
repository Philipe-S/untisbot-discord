# webuntis-disbot
This is my project for creating a Bot that can get Data from the WebUntis API and detect changes in the timetable. The detected changes will then be processed to create a visual Output Timetable (currently done with the Python plotly library). The Visual Output can then be sent to a Discord channel with a Discord Bot.

## Current state
The project is currently just a side thing I am doing, so the progress will not be that fast. Also I am not that good ad programming and I am still learning a lot, especially with this project. 
Because of that the Code will not be the most efficient and clean, I am firstly programming everything without really caring about clean code and file naming, though that is something I will change later on (so the Files, Functions etc. with german names will be completely translated to englisch when the project is at a functional state.

The current state is also quite hard-coded, also it is hard coded to my schools WebUntis style, that will be changed later on too, so other users with other school implementations of WebUntis will be able to use it.

## Plans
My plans for this is to learn better programming. I will now program everything for my usage (my schools style of webuntis implementation, only for the shedules etc.). When that is finished I will soft-code it so it can be (with some configuration) used with all kinds of school implementations of webuntis.

After I am done soft coding my plan is to add other features such as other exporting possibilities and additional notification features (notifications for exams etc.). If I am still continuing the project I might also add support for other Platforms (not only Discord).

## Why Python?
You may be asking yourself why I am using Python. There is a quite simple answer: It's the Language I have the most knowledge in and I like the language.
I know there may be a better way to do this but therefore I would have to learn a whole new language (I want to stick to learning one for now).
